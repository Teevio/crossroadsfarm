      <title>Oh Grow Up!</title>
      <link>http://crossroadsfarm.org/blogs/oh-grow-up/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 19 Mar 2013 13:51 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>http://crossroadsfarm.org/blogs/oh-grow-up/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/workspace/uploads/jrleisure.jpg" style="float: left; width: 50px; height: 106px; " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever looked back at the pictures you have of you when you were a freshman in High School? Do you remember how grown up you thought you were?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a picture of me in a leisure suite with a big bow tie, and high heeled shows. My hair was split down the middle and wigged out on both sides above my ears. Yep. It pays to be around the day the clown dies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recall feeling, not only, dashing, stylish and cool, but I actually thought that I looked old. I was positive that 17-year-old girls probably wondered who the new senior was. I was my illusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not really embarrassed by the picture because, in 1974 a pale blue leisure suit was stylish and somewhat cool. If I still wore my hair the same way today however, I would have cause for embarrassment. Style has moved on past the 70&amp;#8217;s. It moved past the Bee Gees, permed Afro&amp;#8217;s for white guys, and the over-heightened shoes. My ankles, record player and mirror have all expressed gratitude to me in writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spiritually, I have also moved on. I have grown in my understanding of God&amp;#8217;s grace, love, sacrifice, provision and expectation for my life. In short, I am living each day in pursuit of a deeper, richer, more faithful and anticipatory faith than the one I understood as a freshman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someday, I will write a book about the adolescent faith I see expressed by life-long believers. I will call it , &amp;#8220;Stalled At Fourteen.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know some people who are stalled at the developmental age of 14. What that means is that they have not progressed emotionally, mentally or spiritually since their freshman year in High school and their lives reflect that. Their church politics reflect it. Their commitment to evangelism, giving, service, sacrifice and discipline reflects it. Frankly, our commitments to Church, marriage, missions and Bible study, you know, the old fashioned stuff, reflects it. They will not: simply refuse to work at their faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pervading sentiment among most Christians that I encounter is that my mediocrity is what God is happy with. He should be happy that I made it to church. He should be happy for a twenty in the offering plate. God should be pleased if I occasionally help out by ushering, working the nursery or painting a church in the third world once a decade. The fact is, that we have looked at ourselves in the spiritual mirror and congratulated ourselves for looking so grown up in our leisure suit. God saw it coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1 Corinthians chapter three, Paul scolds the immature church in Corinth for the mentality that I have sometimes. He said, in verse 2,&amp;#160; &amp;#8220;I gave you milk, not solid food, for you were not yet ready for it. Indeed, you are still not ready.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of you may be inclined to yell, &amp;#8220;Wait! We are supposed to be like babies in our faith! In Matthew 19:14, Jesus said, &amp;#34;Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somebody else may say, &amp;#8220;Yes! And don&amp;#8217;t forget that in 1 Peter 2:2, God said,&amp;#160; &amp;#8220;Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up in your salvation,&amp;#8221;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep. It is true that we all start faith like babies. I wonder if it isn&amp;#8217;t time to move past diapers and bottles. It is time to move beyond the Bee Gees and the pale blue leisure suit. We don&amp;#8217;t really look as mature as we think.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Greeting Tradition in the Era of Hand Sanitizer </title>
      <link>http://crossroadsfarm.org/blogs/the-greeting-tradition-in-the-era-of-hand-sanitizer/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 09 Nov 2012 11:26 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>http://crossroadsfarm.org/blogs/the-greeting-tradition-in-the-era-of-hand-sanitizer/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
	&amp;#160;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I was standing in a church where I was about to speak and the pastor announced, with a sadistic smile that it was time to greet each other. This statement was welcomed with a din of unbridled collective chatter. Being new to the church, I did what all newcomers do. I held my ground. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I believe that the church is the last place where we actively and systematically &amp;#8220;Greet&amp;#8221; people. If you consider it for very long, you probably would realize, along with me, that this tradition of accosting people we do not recognize with zealous niceness, is maybe&amp;#8230; Ummm&amp;#8230; frightening.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Place yourself at Walmart. A gregarious voice comes over the speakers heralding that it is 10:00 A.M. walmart-time. That means that you are to welcome other shoppers to the store. How would that fly? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&amp;#8217;m the type of person that doesn&amp;#8217;t mind meeting new people, shaking a few hands and perhaps, if the atmosphere is just right, exchanging warm hugs. If the welcoming ritual happened at a store, however, I bowl over the door greeter in an attempt to get out. As it was, being that I had to stay and speak at the church, I protected myself by coughing and sneezing directly into my own hands each time someone approached.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immediately, after the greeting period, indicated by a few quips by the worship leader regarding how friendly this church was, I could literally smell gallons of hand sanitizer being poured over the welcoming hands.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imagine Jesus, after he touches the leper in Matthew, chapter eight, runs down to the river and begins to scrub off his top three layers of skin. It may make an impression that Jesus was less convinced of the healing than the rest of us. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I suppose my thoughts on the matter are pretty simple. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whenever we institutionalize something personal, it makes it creepy. If the people of God took this principle of welcome outside the doors of the church and hugged, loved and invited a culture of lepers into our lives, the gospel of Christ would become vibrant. We need to take it outside.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just in case God tells me to do something for a leper. I have purchased a small pocket sized hand sanitizer. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matthew 8:17 This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#8220;He took up our infirmities&lt;br /&gt;
and carried our diseases.&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Hopeless Romantic</title>
      <link>http://crossroadsfarm.org/blogs/hopeless-romantic/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 25 Sep 2012 13:13 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>http://crossroadsfarm.org/blogs/hopeless-romantic/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/workspace/uploads/hope.jpg" style="width: 100px; height: 44px; " /&gt;&amp;#160;School has retired summer vacation and sent it to the hopeful optimism of next year with full book bags, this year&amp;#8217;s fashions by Old Navy and enough peanut butter and jelly sandwiches to feed a third world country. Kids arrive in the school parking lots delivered via B-29 bomb-drop from formations of honeybee colored carriers, neutrally painted SUVs and Mini-vans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Young students rush toward friends whom they have not seen in three months and exchange wide-eyed welcomes. It takes me back to my own first days of school. They were so full of hope and potential. Maybe the football team will go to state this year. This is the year that I get straight &amp;#8220;A&amp;#8217;s&amp;#8221;. There could be romance with that new kid. I may move up a social class and move away from the &amp;#8220;dweeb&amp;#8221; lunch table. Some of these aspirations may be based in realism. Some may not be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that the greatest motivations for going back to school are the unrealistic hopes that fuel optimism. There is a desire for the miraculous. It also dawned on me that that is why I get out of bed, get married, order something different at a restaurant or watch sports. I have a craving for the unexplainable, the supernatural and the wishfully optimistic. I am a romantic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wondered this morning as I wrote this, if we, as Christians have forgotten how to hope. I have sat in a fair amount of church board meetings where the focus is on what we should not do based on the evident realities, rather that the possibilities based on God moving. We spend far too much time reckoning and far too little time praying. We spend far too much time protecting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We protect our comfort, our sacred cows, our bank accounts, our children, our careers and ourselves. I have discovered that I have a propensity to shield myself, even the parts that I do not like, from change. I don&amp;#8217;t really want to be different, more faithful, more like Jesus or without sin. I like my sin. Righteousness is too hard and waiting for God&amp;#8217;s hand requires trust. Trust is for the na&amp;#239;ve. We are more about action. We are more about our action justified by our logic. God should sit this one out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hope rests in new beginnings. Faith resides in risk. Risk demands wisdom. Wisdom guides leadership. Leadership must be directed by God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;James 1:5 If any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to him.&amp;#160; 6 But when he asks, he must believe and not doubt, because he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind.&amp;#160; 7 That man should not think he will receive anything from the Lord;&amp;#160; 8 he is a double-minded man, unstable in all he does.&amp;#160;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And there is the death of hope.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

      <title>Position Available</title>
      <link>http://crossroadsfarm.org/blogs/position-available/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 01 Jun 2012 19:39 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>http://crossroadsfarm.org/blogs/position-available/</guid>
      <description>&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left: 40px; "&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/workspace/uploads/100564_available_image.jpg" style="border-top-width: 2px; border-right-width: 2px; border-bottom-width: 2px; border-left-width: 2px; border-top-style: solid; border-right-style: solid; border-bottom-style: solid; border-left-style: solid; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; margin-top: 2px; margin-bottom: 2px; float: left; width: 227px; height: 222px; " /&gt;&amp;#8220;The man with the antiserum is only as successful as his being available to the man with the snakebite.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DR&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog, we&amp;#8217;ll be working through the character issue of &amp;#8220;Availability.&amp;#8221; We need to be able to apply this character trait to our lives in light of the fact that our day has created distance. Availability is defined by Webster as, &amp;#8220;At hand or accessible, capable of being used or gotten.&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible defines it this way, &amp;#8220;The Lord came and stood there, calling as at other times, &amp;#8216;Samuel, Samuel!&amp;#8217; Then Samuel said, &amp;#8216;Speak, for your servant is listening.&amp;#8217;&amp;#8221; 1 Sam. 3:10&lt;br /&gt;
Being available is more than a case of wishful thinking or good intention. God&amp;#8217;s word warns us that faith without works is dead. Availability is a matter of being where God wants you at the exact moment of a need. Here is a dirty little secret. The busier we become in pursuit of our stuff, the less available we are to do any of God&amp;#8217;s stuff.&lt;br /&gt;
There are so many things that keep us from being able to hear and obey God&amp;#8217;s voice. One of those things is position.&lt;br /&gt;
I have coached quite a few young basketball players in the art of playing effective offense and being ready to score. The trick is to set your feet in a position of readiness. In other words, a player has to be ready to catch the basketball while facing the basket. Ephesians 6 talks about the armor of God. Here is what it says about positioning.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#8220;15 and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace.&amp;#8221;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being available is considered a part of the way we are protected from Satan&amp;#8217;s schemes. That concept makes me ask, &amp;#8220;Protect us from what?&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;
I think that one of those schemes today is to keep us wrapped up in our own plans. God&amp;#8217;s will, can be consumed by our own desires. Matthew 22:1-10 is the story of the king who prepared a tremendous feast. When he invited others to attend they had other things to do. The end result is that the friends who were originally invited missed the party. Availability protects us from a fruitless spiritual walk.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Failure!</title>
      <link>http://crossroadsfarm.org/blogs/failure/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 19 Apr 2012 21:50 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>http://crossroadsfarm.org/blogs/failure/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p style="margin-left: 160px; "&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/workspace/uploads/failure.jpg" style="width: 310px; height: 373px; " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left: 160px; "&gt;In the movie, Fellowship of the Ring, there is a powerful statement that Gandalph seethes at Frodo after the young hobbit has offered the ring to him. He says, &amp;#8220;Don&amp;#39;t tempt me Frodo! I dare not take it: Not even to keep it safe. Understand Frodo, I would use this ring from a desire to do good, but through me it would wield a power too great and powerful to imagine.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has me wondering how many of us feel the call of ministry only to have it swallowed up in our own selfish kingdom building? What if, as was the case with the disciples, the kingdom that Christ is using us to build is actually far different than the one we desire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So what happens when my ministry looks more like a Jerry Springer show than a Youth group ideas book? How do I resolve the fact that success for my ministry is measured, somedays, by whether the middle school boys flushed. When conference speakers are talking about the injection of the Holy Spirit,why do I most often believe that the answer to our ministry problems could be solved by issuing tranquilizing darts to my volunteers? When other youth workers give updates that seem more like a greatest hits recitation, how is it that I am embarrassed to say that we have two kids being discipled by a staffer and a couple of our missing kids showed up to an event? We have the unhealthy tendency to evaluate what God is doing, based on our personal fulfillment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I realize that we have have the propensity to desire our unrealistic expectations for the purpose of self importance and recognition. I fight with my pride on this. Whereas it is true that I have great intentions for the Kingdom, and it is also true that I pray for only what God has for me on a personal level, when it comes to the things that I want to do for Him, I want more and more. I have found that my ambition to serve the Lord can lead me to dissatisfaction. It is a spiritual issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I need a measuring staff for my ministry that immerses me in Christ&amp;#39;s reality and value. By evaluating my ministry based on a few of the lessons I have learned from Christ&amp;#39;s own ministry. These are principles that are hardly the kind that will find themselves on the main stage of a youth ministry conference. In some respects they can be as demotivating as a real day in ministry can be. It also will be a standard that I need the Holy Spirit to raise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I have to consistently remind myself that God has not required my assistance in anything he wants to do. Instead, he is at work in me, through the process of His will.Tough stuff. Here is my &amp;#8220;Go-to&amp;#8221; list for true accountability in working towards God&amp;#39;s will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;1.Ministry is not popularity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Christ himself understood that he would be rejected. Ministry has a propensity to drive us to a desire to popularity. When we judge our success by numbers alone, we have set a bar that Christ set for us. There are occasions when God will move and critical mass happens, but it is not to be our measurement of ministry value.&amp;#160; Mark 8:31&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2. Break-Ups are inevitabl&lt;/strong&gt;e&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible is full of difficult passages about disagreements and the parting of ways. One of the best known was the disagreement between Paul and Barnabas over the value of John Mark&amp;#39;s service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I remember being taught that God used the split to further perpetuate the gospel. I do believe that, but it does not change the struggle that it must have been for both, Paul and Barnabas. I believe that both men must have been in anguish over the break. It must have weighed on them both. How could God allow a dear friend to be so wrong?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The truth is that we must accept that opinions can divide, and we will have differences of opinion that will cause divides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;3. Some partners will cause damage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When Judas abandoned Christ, it was with malice and in spite of the fact that God used it to bring about his salvation, caused death. It also was the step to a suicide. I cannot begin to understand God&amp;#39;s ways, but I can recognize how the people must of talked about Jesus leadership. The conversations must have been laced with criticism and sarcasm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In ministry, not all partings are simple. Students leave. Staff leaves. Sometimes they do not like you. Sometimes they will talk. Sometimes they will cause damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	4. No one boasts in the failures&lt;br /&gt;
	There are thousands of untold stories in the Bible. I am compelled by those. I wonder how many people left the hill side an hour before dinner and thought, &amp;#8220;Yeah. Jesus is an interesting speaker, but I gotta get something to eat.&amp;#8221;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
They not only would have missed the miracle of the loaves and the fish, and likely missed the message of the Bread of Life.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#160; Peter sunk. Thomas doubted him. One of the men hanging beside him refused to grasp his one last chance. There were pharisees in every crowd, catching the grammatical errors but missing the truth of the ages. For every believer, there were ten crucifiers. For everyone who heard, there were thousands who did not. Jesus didn&amp;#39;t heal everyone, and it is likely that some spent their life denying the power of Christ, while others simply held their illnesses against Him. This is the part that kills me. Christ knew all of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I am denied the paralyzing knowledge of each way and person I have, and am failing every day. That is grace that I need. I have found that the single most energizing thought I can have is this. Grace resides in failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Paul put it this way. &amp;#8220;He is made strong in my weakness.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
No problem there. Weakness is my strength. &amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Drift Fatigue</title>
      <link>http://crossroadsfarm.org/blogs/drift-fatigue/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 03 Apr 2012 12:14 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>http://crossroadsfarm.org/blogs/drift-fatigue/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A squid boat which was lost a year ago during the 2011 tsunami was recently spotted. It was drifting about 120 nautical miles off the coast of British Columbia. It seems sad to me. What have the squid guys been &amp;#8220;Squiding&amp;#8221; with for a year? Did they put up pictures of the boat at all of the, ummm, maritime bars, asking if you see this boat to please call the phone number. We do it for puppies, kittens and bicycles. It seems reasonable for someone to put posters around town for a missing boat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of my fascination with the story is that I never get to use the word squid in a reasonable conversation, and then, &amp;#8220;Bam!&amp;#8221; just like that I can use a whole year&amp;#39;s worth of squid-word-rations, all day long. People are actually marginally impressed with my knowledge of odd current events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth however is that I am actually repulsed by the concept of squid fishing. Even if I were to catch one, I don&amp;#39;t mind saying that I wouldn&amp;#39;t want to touch it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve only encountered real squid at a restaurant. By that time, it was cut up into cute little ringlets of rubbery, buttery fish-like food. My questions are always the same on exotic foods. Are we so desperate for food that this grotesque creature looks appetizing? Sure. If I am Chuck Noland, (Tom Hanks&amp;#39; character from Castaway) I can be tempted to eat something out of sheer boredom, but there are still frozen TV dinners I haven&amp;#39;t tried at the Piggly Wiggly. I am going to make sure that I have sampled all available, common foods before I resort to ingesting an alien-like, cephalapod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe that explains why the boat was lost and not reclaimed earlier. The squid-guys moved on to work as Honda salesmen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What caught my attention was a single sentence. It read, &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s been drifting across the Pacific for a year, so it&amp;#8217;s pretty beat up.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder if that is not the explanation for most people&amp;#39;s exhaustion with life. Drifting always makes the trip take longer. It puts us into uncharted waters. It leaves us unprepared for parts of the journey. That wears on a person. It wears on a marriage. It wears on a ministry, a career, a family, our faith. Drifting, or living accidentally, allows each new shift of the the currents to make a victim of us. It creates a chaos and doubt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a straight line that leaves us less wind worn. It is a direct path to where we are aiming. It is a peaceful path, but one of deliberate course. The tsunamis that rage against our life&amp;#39;s fulfillment and joy can set even the most planned ministry adrift into the sea of doubt, instability and self reliance. That course is the only &amp;#8220;true north&amp;#8221; on the raging torrents of ministry, relationships and decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real danger comes when we adjust to the currents of criticism and setback. I often times begin to reassess the vision for the trek. I find myself dead-reckoning. I veer off course for hours at a time when the assault come. Oh, they will come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few key principles that I have applied to ministry that keep me from becoming a derelict, a beaten and blasted fragment of the proud traveller, or worse, a ghost ship, the vessel that has no life left in it except for the physicality of staying afloat. Here they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. One of my mentors, a man named Don Lonie, used to remind me that God is more concerned with who I am in Him than what I do for Him. It is critical for me to realize that the destination that I deem so critical to God&amp;#39;s mission for my life is actually his tool for shaping me. God is moving me where he wants, in the shape that he wants me.&lt;br /&gt;
2. Another of my mentors, Bill Bullard, has reminded me that if God has another to steer the ship He would have selected them initially. His selection was me for this stretch of the journey, regardless of the many detractors. Besides this, he reminds me that I am riding God&amp;#39;s ship. He set the course. As long as I make sure that I am heading where He desires, I am not lost.&lt;br /&gt;
3. Peter, in the book of Matthew has given me the most stabilizing nautical advice when he asked,&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#160; &amp;#34;Lord, if it&amp;#39;s you,&amp;#34; Peter replied, &amp;#34;tell me to come to you on the water.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; Matthew 14:28&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; Hmmm. Just what is my destination anyway? &amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Grace, the Youth Worker and the Age of Social Media</title>
      <link>http://crossroadsfarm.org/blogs/grace-the-youth-worker-and-the-age-of-social-media/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 26 Mar 2012 14:07 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>http://crossroadsfarm.org/blogs/grace-the-youth-worker-and-the-age-of-social-media/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow, it happens. Those of us who are committed to keeping our ears to the social relevance track, can get run over by the Bieber train. I was looking through my twitter feed and discovered that I was getting updates from Selena Gomez, Miley Cyrus and the band Big Time Rush. I suspected it has something to do with the three young teenage daughters I have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a national pass-time to keep up with people who make news. I have a few friends who live very public lives in front of millions. Their lot is not one I want. I can barely keep from stepping on my own tongue in front of my own limited circle of friends and staff. The most familiar pattern I continue to repeat is to post or tweet an emotional response, only to realize that it would most likely be misunderstood by too many. Then I delete it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my greatest fears is that as I get older, I may lose my filter. I am worried that as an elderly man I may let lose with all of the statements that I have held back over the years. My filter is held in place by only the smallest thread of concern for the perceptions of others. It&amp;#39;s a pretty unsure mooring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe that is why I am so sensitive to the sin that comes directly from our involvement on the informational fast track. It is so simple to gossip now. It is a one click sin. It requires no premeditation. All we have to do is listen.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&lt;br /&gt;
I have encountered it several times&amp;#160; in the last few months. A friend will tell me about a tweet from a famous minister that is inappropriate, or even wrong. They know it&amp;#39;s true because it was on their blog, twitter or Facebook account. I listen. Now I have to determine if the information is relevant. It may even be preachable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also gossip. It brings big people down and brings common people up. It also makes me a judge of motivations, meanings and nuance. Dangerous stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My simple word to the wise is this. In 2 Timothy 2:26, Paul states that his prayer is this, &amp;#8220;that they will come to their senses and escape from the trap of the devil, who has taken them captive to do his will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have so much more information now with which to be discerning. It is a responsibility for me to demonstrate so much more discernment that ever before. As a leader of students, and many of them have very little else to worry about besides whether Tim and Taylor are dating, I need to show them how to have information with an equal douse of grace. Here is my simple recipe for being a grace-giver.&lt;br /&gt;
1. I don&amp;#39;t read because I&amp;#39;m curious.&lt;br /&gt;
That is the same thing as researching a rumor through my network of middle-schoolers. Social media is too vast to hold accountable. I&amp;#39;ll wait until Kim Kardashian tells me herself before I react.&lt;br /&gt;
2. I cannot be the passer of information unless I am the solver of the crisis.&lt;br /&gt;
The truth here is that a tweet is not a desperate cry for my evaluation of lifestyles. Justin will have to call me before I let him know whether he should stay single for a while after his break-up.&lt;br /&gt;
3. Consider the source.&lt;br /&gt;
Anything designed to get me to gossip comes from a bad source. I would rather talk about something that matters.&amp;#160;&lt;br /&gt;
4. I am not smart, perceptive or attentive enough to evaluate.&lt;br /&gt;
Sometimes, I can misunderstand something that I heard, firsthand. I have had arguments over things that happen in my own home. I am going to have to be okay with the fact that I am not called to head the media police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lord, make me a grace giver in the information age. Let me be deaf to the noise that shapes my opinions. Let me be a hearer of truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got to hit my Linked In box. I hear there&amp;#39;s some more dirt about Steve Jobs.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Love Each Other Abundantly</title>
      <link>http://crossroadsfarm.org/blogs/love-each-other-abundantly/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 24 Feb 2012 16:26 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>http://crossroadsfarm.org/blogs/love-each-other-abundantly/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/workspace/uploads/creed_family.74181144_std.jpg" style="border-top-width: 3px; border-right-width: 3px; border-bottom-width: 3px; border-left-width: 3px; border-top-style: solid; border-right-style: solid; border-bottom-style: solid; border-left-style: solid; margin-left: 3px; margin-right: 3px; margin-top: 3px; margin-bottom: 3px; float: left; width: 248px; height: 252px; " /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 3 in The Family Creed Series&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life can be pretty full as a parent. Full is a good thing sometimes. Sometimes it is just full. Rich is a better word for me. The difference is macaroni and cheese versus cheesecake. I will eat both. Both are filling. One needs ketchup. The other is rich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was teaching my five-year-old to ride a two-wheeler one summer not so long ago. She had never lacked for confidence. In truth she relished the chance to show of her own new skill set, like a fighter pilot buzzing the tower. We had a new flight controller, a friend, over for dinner one night and like all kids, my daughter assumed that she was there because news of this two-wheeled phenom had spread several counties over. She dragged our friend outside to watch this Cirque de Sole&amp;#39;esque demonstration of balance, speed and danger.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stood, smiling at the excitement in my daughter&amp;#39;s eyes as she tore around our driveway circle laughing like I&amp;#39;d imagine Evil Kneival laughed at the edge of every ramp he rode off of. In my mind, I heard Steppenwolf kick into a song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She raced around the drive and as she skidded around a bend yelled, &amp;#8220;I was born to do this!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A split second later the handlebars cranked sideways and she rocketed over them and across the stone gravel. When she stopped skidding she screamed. It was not a pained scream. It was an angry scream. &amp;#8220;But I was not born for that!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We schedule fullness in. Sometimes when we schedule fulness and abundance. But that is not what God said. He said he came to give abundance to us. I tend to try to manipulate abundance through things, experiences and time.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said that He came to give abundant life. I have tried to put that in some perspective. In my family creed. The creed was just a way to put our values in a way that we could hang onto them when life conspired against them. Our first core family value is to LOVE EACH OTHER ABUNDANTLY!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are times when I want to love my family out of my fulness. I run out. I get short with them. I become selfish and controlling. Our family commitment to love abundantly comes from our commitment to be love for each other.&lt;br /&gt;
1 John 4:7 Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. 8 Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love. 9 This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a profound truth in that passage. It is that God is love. He doesn&amp;#39;t just give it. He is love. I have learned that the key to my family experiencing love is not for me to give it as a gift, but instead, for me to be love. When I allow Christ to be love through me, then the love in our home never runs out. It&amp;#39;&amp;#39;s a supernatural thing. It&amp;#39;s a spirit&amp;#160; thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rich.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>We Need a Hero</title>
      <link>http://crossroadsfarm.org/blogs/we-need-a-hero/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Feb 2012 12:44 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>http://crossroadsfarm.org/blogs/we-need-a-hero/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The only responses to need are avoidance or heroism. A delayed hero, is no hero of all. I wonder how often heroism is simply too late.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late 1864, not more than a half a year before the president was assassinated, another famous american actor, with the last name of Booth, made headlines because of someone named Lincoln. The actor was Edwin Booth, John Wilkes&amp;#39; brother, and the beneficiary of his actions was Robert Todd Lincoln, the presidents&amp;#39; son. It seems that Robert had been forced against a train car which had begun to move. The movement caused Robert to fall onto the train tracks in New York city. Edwin, acting on sheer impulse reached out quickly and grabbed young Robert by the collar and hoisted him back onto the loading platform in one continuous motion. The action saved Lincoln&amp;#39;s life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heroism is an awkward thing. There are several critical components needed to be a hero. Just in case you have plans to become one, this is a great list to have in your pocket.&lt;br /&gt;
1. Crisis&lt;br /&gt;
2. Opportunity&lt;br /&gt;
3. Decisive and immediate action&lt;br /&gt;
4. A quick change costume&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&lt;br /&gt;
Actually, I added the last prerequisite on my own. I guess it just would feel more dramatic if the person saving you from certain tragedy is wearing spandex and a cape. I prefer the colors of purple and neon green. Being a hero in spandex does place a higher priority on working out. There is a strong motivation to stay fit if you know that the television crews are going to be filming and you are wearing skin tight spandex. That&amp;#39;s why I might suggest the mask as well. In the long run, I decided to make number four optional. The other three are pretty certain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of these elements are readily available. People everywhere are in crisis. There is poverty, illness, loneliness, depression, spiritual emptiness and moral desperation and an occasional beached whale. You don&amp;#39;t need to write this one on your list because it is so prevalent.&amp;#160; The issue with need is what kind of hero are you designed to be? In other words, it is a good idea to know what you can rescue people from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not that strong a swimmer. The realization of my limits will help me in not attempting to rescue someone who is drowning. The truth is that I believe each person has a &amp;#8220;Heroes Skill Set&amp;#8221;. Most people never take the time to determine what their skill set calls them to act upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second necessary component is opportunity. Again, no problem there. I can have my pick of worthy causes. I can save the California Condor, end global warming, stop political corruption, help students read, deliver meals to the elderly, babysit for a new mom, stop to help a stranded motorist, fund a missionary, start a small group, dig a well in Africa, and anything else that needs to be done. The problem again is that I have not determined what God has asked me to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You and I have unique passions, concerns, abilities and resources. I always wondered how Superman determined who he would rescue and who would have to die. I think the choice could be debilitating for a hero. I can see Superman sitting on a couch paralyzed by the demands. Now he just sits and tries to figure out how to make the perfect decision. I think that was what the ice fortress was all about. Even Superman needs to chill. (I just cracked myself up).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The true mark of a hero is the third item on the list. A hero is bound by immediate, pressing and personal need. Drowning victims can&amp;#39;t wait while we decide to act. That is fairly unfair of&amp;#160; crisis. It places demands on us. When New Orleans flooded, the need for support was pressing. There was no understanding when the process took too long. That&amp;#39;s because people died waiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a thought. Spiritual need waits too. The call of&amp;#160; every believer is the same. Now is the appointed time. &amp;#8220;What?&amp;#8221; is the question that each believer is asked to answer for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Power of the Stay</title>
      <link>http://crossroadsfarm.org/blogs/the-power-of-the-stay/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/workspace/uploads/kerpsilo.jpg" style="border-top-width: 5px; border-right-width: 5px; border-bottom-width: 5px; border-left-width: 5px; border-top-style: solid; border-right-style: solid; border-bottom-style: solid; border-left-style: solid; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; float: left; width: 425px; height: 283px; " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple man passed into eternity last night following his struggle with cancer. His legacy however is less simple. His hallmark, a watershed of stability and consistency, was his ability to stay. More than that, I think. His life was a determination to stay. Jack Kerspilo.&amp;#160; I doubt that you will ever hear of&amp;#160; him unless you happen to be traveling through South-central Michigan and stumble across the High School gymnasium that bears his name. This community however, will not forget for a hundred years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is one of the last of his kind. The kind who coached and taught in order to give to a community. He ate at the local restaurants, knew the kids of his former players and the kids of the kids of former players. It was that he was here for nearly three full generations that made the impact. Everyone knew his flaws. Everyone knew his strengths. He stayed long enough. He created the culture of sport in a tiny Michigan town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not meant to be the story of Jack&amp;#39;s life. In the first place, I would not be the one to tell it. But I can apply the principles from a small piece of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Youth workers, pastors, business owners all seem to be in a constant searchlight vigil for the next new thing that will propel their businesses, churches or ministries forward. I am a career youth worker, and in an era where the average tenure of youth worker is a little over one and a half years, I would like to propose the secret of an impacting ministry. Stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last. Endure, survive long enough to know and to be known. Pray that God will help you to bear with the people you are called to serve, and to blind them to your downsides long enough to become, theirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks coach. That&amp;#39;s a good lesson.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 2 of an 8 Part Series on Your Family&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They looked at me and said with all the conviction they could muster, &amp;#8220;But we have teenagers. It is too late to start something like this.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that is a lot like saying, &amp;#8220;I&amp;#39;ve fallen to this ledge. I might as well throw myself the rest of the way down the cliff.&amp;#8221; It may even be more like saying, &amp;#8220;I am so lost there&amp;#39;s no sense in looking at a map.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be like ordering a cheeseburger at a restaurant, finding out that the meat is bad, the cheese is moldy, the bun is rock hard and you find a toenail in it. You finish eating it though based on the principle that you have already started it. And then you go back to the restaurant again and order another toenail burger every day. That would be dumb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is never too late to do something right and to stop doing things without reason. Every family already lives by a creed. It makes me laugh when I hear that it is too late to put a little wisdom into parenting. Quite a few families live by the motto, &amp;#8220;If it&amp;#39;s in front of us we&amp;#39;ll do it.&amp;#8221; That is called the Tyranny of the Urgent Creed. It means that we are willing to raise kids accidentally. That seems crazy to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertisers put more thought into what our kids will eat, listen to, wear and do than most parents do. Too many families are raised by the school system. That is by no means a rip on teachers either. I just know that the governments control public schools. I just don&amp;#39;t feel confident that anything run by our government can produce well rounded, spiritually grounded kids. Seriously, have you seen the tax code? How confusing can something get? I want for my children to understand the purpose of life not to comply with the codes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why many families would rather make it up as they go along. If you think that life is an undesigned journey, and that a plan will steal the freedom, just do your next vacation that way. Get in a car and drive. My family tried that once and ended up in Toledo for four days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, a creed is simply the grid that we sift our lives through. It is not a system of rules. It is never to late to apply a few guiding principle to how we live as a family. As I write this concept down, I would suggest that this could be a fun family discussion. Ask each kid in your family what they want from their family and go from there. Create it together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Families are not really one set of parent&amp;#39;s responsibility. In talking about the things that YOUR family will be about, you have shared the vision and perpetuated a legacy.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
