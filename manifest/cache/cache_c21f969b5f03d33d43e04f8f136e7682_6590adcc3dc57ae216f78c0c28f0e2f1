I am the father of two kids now in their twenties, who as teens, were involved in CRF.  It was the impact of CRF on them that drew me to be involved.  Now, MANY years later, I still enjoy being a part of this ministry team and helping to lead kids to a relationship with Christ.  Outside of CRF, I love to fish and run…..but usually not at the same time!</p></description></p><p style="clear:both"></p></li><li><p><img src="http://www.crossroadsfarm.org/image/2/200/300/5/img_8505.jpg" /></p><h4>Bennett </h4><p><description><p>This is my first year as a Coach at Crossroads.  My dad was the first intern with Crossroads WAY back in 1999.  I’m a student at Spring Arbor University and I love working with middle school kids.</p></description></p><p style="clear:both"></p></li><li class="odd"><p><img src="http://www.crossroadsfarm.org/image/2/200/300/5/maggie_wittenbach.jpg" /></p><h4>Maggie </h4><p><description><p>This is my first year as a Coach.  Once upon a time, in the “mysterious” land of Camden, MI two wicked awesome people had four kids before they had me.  But hey, perfection takes time, Jack!  So….I also love my cat, I am always on the lookout for Bigfoot, and Jesus is my best friend.</p></description></p><p style="clear:both"></p></li><li><p><img src="http://www.crossroadsfarm.org/image/2/200/300/5/nancy_mcneil.jpg" /></p><h4>Nancy </h4><p><description><p>This is my 5th year as a Coach.  I wrestle rhinos in my spare time….which is really none.  Instead I get to love teens and serve Jesus at Crossroads Farm.  When I’m not volunteering, I’m working as an office manager or being an amazing wife and mother.</p></description></p><p style="clear:both"></p></li><li class="odd"><p><img src="http://www.crossroadsfarm.org/image/2/200/300/5/alyssa_hobson.jpg" /></p><h4>Alyssa </h4><p><description><p>This is my 1st year as a Coach.  I recently moved to Hillsdale County to find Jesus’ heart in the midst of cornfields and fireflies.  I’m getting my Bachelor’s degree in Psychology with the hopes of working with teenage girls in a counseling setting.  I love to write and read, and people’s stories are my favorite.  My addiction to Chapstick is getting out of hand.  If there are stars and a bonfire, I’m there.  Bonus points if a lake is involved.  I don’t run and wild Peruvian pig once licked my foot.  Coffee is probably, definitely my love language…that or sunsets.  I’m SO PUMPED for this year at CRF!</p></description></p><p style="clear:both"></p></li><li><p><img src="http://www.crossroadsfarm.org/image/2/200/300/5/steve_boyd.jpg" /></p><h4>Steve </h4><p><description><p>This is my 4th year as a Coach….blah, blah blah!

I am the daughter of an Army chaplain and a Hillsdale native.  Allison grew up moving around the world.  She is currently attending Hillsdale College and is enjoying the chance to live in Michigan, the place she has been visiting her whole life.  Allison enjoys playing piano, reading, and hanging out with friends.  She is thankful and excited for the opportunity to be involved with CRF this year.</p></description></p><p style="clear:both"></p></li><li><p><img src="http://www.crossroadsfarm.org/image/2/200/300/5/connie_richardson.jpg" /></p><h4>Connie </h4><p><description><p>This is my 13th year as a Coach.  We, (Mike and I), have been involved with CRF for the past 13 years.  I love that we have a ministry in our community that teens can go to as a safe place that meets spiritual, emotional, and physical needs.  I love the color yellow.  I love hugs, smiley faces, and sharing God’s love!</p></description></p><p style="clear:both"></p></li><li class="odd"><p><img src="http://www.crossroadsfarm.org/image/2/200/300/5/nikki_pridgeon.jpg" /></p><h4>Nikki </h4><p><description><p>I’m originally from Traverse City, MI, but I met a hunk at CMU, who just happens to be a pig farmer.  So now I live in Reading with the hunk.  Rural living was a huge change for me but I love gardening, riding in a giant combine, and serving at Crossroads Farm.  I am actually a physical therapist.</p></description></p><p style="clear:both"></p></li><li><h4>Teresa </h4><p><description><p>This is my first year with Crossroads.  I grew up in Osseo but live in the Waldron/Hudson area.  I have mad driving skills as I fly from bus stop to bus stop.  (I am the Super Driver - and this year will be driving the CRF bus!)

I have 2 super girls who have grown into super women and one amazing husband.</p></description></p><p style="clear:both"></p></li><li class="odd"><p><img src="http://www.crossroadsfarm.org/image/2/200/300/5/paul_pridgeon.jpg" /></p><h4>Paul </h4><p><description><p>I am a 7th generation hog and crop farmer.  So, I always bring home the bacon and excel at naps.  I met my beautiful wife at Central Michigan University and we got married in 2010.  As a former student at Reading High School and Crossroads Farm, I love being back and involved in the ministry that greatly impacted my life.  I also love the challenge of ministry to high school kids and trying to be as energetic as they are.</p></description></p><p style="clear:both"></p></li><li><p><img src="http://www.crossroadsfarm.org/image/2/200/300/5/img_8976.jpg" /></p><h4>Meg </h4><p><description><p>This is my first year working with Crossroads.

Originally from Toledo, OH but I am currently living in the Hillsdale area.  Dre enjoys bird watching, serenading people with the guitar, and mullet hunting.  She is a fluent speaker in several languages and aspires to get her doctorate degree some day in clown-ology, so people can call her Dr. Dre.  You can usually find her cracking a joke or unicorn wrangling.</p></description></p><p style="clear:both"></p></li><li><p><img src="http://www.crossroadsfarm.org/image/2/200/300/5/jared_wittenbach.jpg" /></p><h4>Jared </h4><p><description><p>I’m Jared and I’ve basically grown up here.
I’m the music man for Barnyard program nights.
This year I have two main goals: 1). To see real worship at CRF… and maybe even be used by God for that.
and 2). To see God move in the lives of high school guys.
I don’t want to say I have an amazing personality, but I’d be lying if I said I didn’t.

I went to Crossroads for 2.5 years as a student, serving one year on the Crew.

I love spending time with my family and if I had to pick a favorite meal it would be lobster, mountain dew, and cheese-its….or maybe lobster boiled in mountain dew and covered with crushed Cheese-its!  If I had a super hero ability, I would love to fly.</p></description></p><p style="clear:both"></p></li><li class="odd"><p><img src="http://www.crossroadsfarm.org/image/2/200/300/5/sarah_kreuz.jpg" /></p><h4>Sarah </h4><p><description><p>I am a student at Hillsdale College and am studying Mathematics.
