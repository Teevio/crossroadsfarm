        <h4>Doug and Dawn Routledge</h4>
        <p>Doug and Dawn Routledge are the founders of Crossroads Farm. While Doug works as the Executive Director, 								  Dawn serves as staff liaison and corporate treasurer. Since their three daughters (Madison, Raegan, and Lauren) will one day be a part of the student ministries team, mom and dad are busy making sure that the program and ministry are paramount. Throughout their 13 years of marriage, they have served together in ministering to students. Doug is an ordained minister with two plus decades of youth ministry under his belt. He speaks at churches, camps, and other youth ministries about 150 times each year while continually writing a large amount of training material for the Farm. Hunting and competing in athletics are among his greatest passions. He has also published several pieces of art.</p>

        <p>Dawn is a gracious hostess who has a warm decorator's touch. Almost every day someone stops by for lunch. Each month she has a group of "adopted" grandparents over for dinner. She also has a teaching degree, which has proven to be useful in building meaningful relationships with students.</p>

        <p>The Routledges are the hands-on trainers for the adult volunteer staff and the student Leadteam. Their passion is to train and equip the next generation of rural youth workers. They earnestly need your prayers as they seek to lead this ministry into the rural country of America.</p>

        <h4>Nancy McNeil</h4>
        <p>Nancy’s voice is usually the first you’ll hear when calling the Farm.  Having been deemed the “whirling dervish of administration”, she is the one who keeps the paperwork flowing and things behind the scenes going (which is what she prefers!)  Nancy first came to Crossroads and the Hillsdale area when she and her husband, Chuck, finished their military service in Virginia, packed up lock, stock &#160; barrel, pets &#160; kids and moved the whole kit-and-caboodle up to Michigan.  Initially working part-time as our bookkeeper, she later assumed full-time duties as Office Manager in addition to Bookkeeper in August of 2006.  Nancy says, “It’s amazing how the simple decision I made when I was 13 for Jesus has impacted my life. God has really prepared me in every way to be serving Him by serving our teens here at CRF.  I sometimes wonder what my life would have been like had there been a ministry like Crossroads Farm when I was growing up.”  Her hobbies include reading, collecting rhinos and sharing totally hilarious adventures about raising two busy boys.</p>

        <h4>Paul Miller</h4>
        <p>My name is Paul A.K.A Bird Man.  I was born in the wee hours of the morn, ok actually 10:44 am. after 27 hrs. of labor (So my mother tells me.) I was a precosious baby learning to walk at 11 months and mastering three letter words by the age of 10 years old. My dream of raising up eagles to carry me around the world to fight the forces of evil would lead me to Crossroads Farm.</p>

          <p>No but really i was born and raised in Hillsdale County, I was a graduate of Pittsford Area High School. After earning an Associates of Science degree from Jackson Community College, I worked for 11 years at a tool &#160; die shop as a Graphics Engineer Tech. Before joining professional staff at Crossroads Farm, I was a part of the voluntter staff for 5 years, thanks to a previous intern named Scott Tyson.</p>

        <p>I have two younger brothers and two nephews. My parents are a very important part of my life, and support me in every thing i do. i enjoy playing basketball (especially with doug) hiking, softball, photogaraphy, teaching AWANA, and traveling.</p>

        <h4>Megan Rupinski</h4>
        <p>My name is Megan A.K.A Meg A.K.A Meganization. My voice may not be the first you hear at Crossroads but if you hear someone snorting when they laugh it is quite possible that it’s me. What can I say, I’m a lightheaded wonder. On May 2009, I officially joined this team as their new program intern! It may seem a tad bit odd but being a part of Crossroads has always been a dream of mine. I have been a supporter of Crossroads for several years but was comfortable at being only that. Unsure exactly what I wanted to be when I grew up I satisfied my thirst for life with a paycheck and doing good for others.  My cushy job and lifestyle suited me just fine, but then God grabbed a hold and changed my heart and now here I am!</p>

        <p>I graduated from Laingsburg High School in 2002, a small town northeast of Lansing. Following that time, I spent my days working in the mortgage industry but by night was a volunteer for my church’s youth group. (No cape or glasses removal required.) I learned that I loved to work with teens and that for some odd reason they enjoyed me (for the most part) as well. Working here at Crossroads allows me to combine my passions and talents into a whirlpool of craziness. It is my hearts desire to bring a new edge to Barnyard and Trough over the next two years and if God so directs for even longer.</p>
