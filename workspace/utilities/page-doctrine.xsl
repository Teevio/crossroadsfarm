        <h3>Doctrinal Statement</h3>
        <h4>The Doctrine of Scripture</h4>
        
        II Timothy 3:16-17 

        “For all Scripture is God breathed and is useful for teaching, for rebuking, for correction and training in righteousness, that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.”

        Statement: CROSSROADS FARM AFFIRMS that the Scriptures, both the Old Testament writing and the New Testament writings are wholly inspired by God. This inspiration is both verbal, meaning that each word is the very word that God chose and plenary, meaning that the entire work together from nuance to subtlety was God breathed. It is the perfect and infallible word of God. There are no additional writings that are to be added to the common of these 66 books, nor are there any of these books that area not the inspired word of God. It is the written truth, the ultimate authority, and the power unto Salvation.

        Support:

        The Scriptures possess several characteristics.

        It is Genuine. Crossroads Farm affirms that the sixty six (66) books in the Common of Scripture are written by the person of persons whose name they bear or anonymous then to the person or persons to whom tradition has attributed the writing to.


        The Apostles claim Christ’s words to be scripture.

        The Apostles verify their own writing as scripture.

        Christ Himself verifies the writing of the Apostles in promise and reference.
        The Psuedopigraphic books or the Aporyphal books lack either textural or authorly integrity.

        It is Credible.

        Crossroads Farm affirms that the books of the Bible are credible because of the following reasons.

        Christ himself used the Old Testament. For example in Matt. 4:4 Christ quotes Deuteronomy 8:3.

        Numerous archeological findings support scriptural accounts i.e.…the discovery of the remains of Tyre or the lack of order in the fossil record.

        The authors have proven continuous accuracy in recording historical data.

        The scriptures are in harmony within themselves. Its unity speaks volumes as to its credibility. It was written over a period of 1,600 years, by over 40 different authors, in three different languages. It still stands as unified from start to finish. 

        The fulfillment of prophecy speaks again to the credibility of the Bible. These literal fulfillments, from the birth, life, death and resurrection of Christ, to the casting of Tyre into the sea, show the reliable nature of Scripture.
        It is inspired.

        Crossroads Farm affirms that God’s word was breathed out in an act of deliberation through the men that God chose to use as His instruments. These men were under the control of the Spirit while writing the Scriptures (II Timothy 3:16, II Peter 1:19-21, John 14:26)

        Crossroads Farm affirms that these authors were given the freedom to write works that also are personal in nature. Each author using his own individual style, vocabulary, and expression. (Acts 28:25)

        It is useful.

        Crossroads Farm affirms that the word of God is to be loved and treasured as “ a light to our path”, a “ rod of correction”, and the “sword of the spirit”. It is the only offensive piece in our arsenal, which God has given us. It is a defense against the attacks of Satan.

        It is testified to as Scripture

        The Old Testament is claimed by Christ as scripture.

        Christ claims His own words as being at least equal to the Old Testament scripture.
