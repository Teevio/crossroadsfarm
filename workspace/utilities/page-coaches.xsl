                <p>I am a teacher at the daVinci Institute in Jackson, MI were I mostly work with the alternative education program. It is quite a challenge but I'm all about positively influencing today's youth to move toward Jesus Christ - both at work and Crossroads Farm. I also love my Rottweiler puppy Ruby, hunting, and construction. I'm serving at CRF together with my wife. We are in our 4th year.</p></li>
                <li><h4 class="bio">Andrea Bernard</h4>
                <p> I enjoy working with youth and families in Hillsdale county. I do this through my job as a social worker and through the ministry of Crossroads Farm. My favorite part is investing in the lives of students. However, I also really enjoy listening to Doug speak and the encouragement of working with a team of people who really love Jesus and live it out in their daily lives. One of my favorite fun moments as a staff member was taking students on the white water rafting adventure, especially when we went down the natural waterslide.</p></li>

                    <p>Dear Potential Fans,<br/> 
                    In order to be good fans you first need some stalking information.  My name is Rich, I'm 29, and my birthday is April 21, 1979.  I love photography and would like it to be part of my full time job/ministry when I grow up.  I've been with Crossroads Farm for almost nine years now and have seen God do things in students' lives that make it worth every bit and more of the time, lack of sleep, energy, money and other sacrifices that it takes to reach a student for Christ.</p>

                    <p>My name is Rod (Rodney) and this is my first year volunteering at CRF. I am the Youth Pastor at New Hope Chruch in Camden and as a church we decided that our youth group would start coming to CRF to experience more in the realm of having a group larger than 5 people. The resources that CRF has out weighs what I can do at New Hope strictly because of the numbers. CRF has two or three times the staff than our entire church and because they have been actively doing Youth Ministry for  almost 10 years here, the experience can do nothing but make each student have a more rounded middle school and high school experience. Whether it is the games that we play at CRF, or the trips we take with CRF, God is always at the center of it all.</p>

                    <p>To me, Crossroads is very special. I attended Crossroads as a student in High School and now I have the opportunity to give back to this great organization by volunteering to work with Senior High girls. There are not many places in Hillsdale County where a teenager can go where he/ she will feel loved, accepted, and have the opportunity to accept Christ as his/ her personal Savior. Crossroads is where I met my husband and where we will serve (Lord willing) for the rest of our lives.</p>

                    <p>As a college student, I like to
                        hang out with people apart from my studies.  I love to sing and play
                        piano and clarinet.  I've been doing all of those for about ten years.  I
                        perform professionally on clarinet.  Singing and playing piano is
                        something I like to give back to God because He's given me so much.  I'm
                        a sophomore, currently, at Spring Arbor University (an amazing christian
                        college).  Apart from my regular studies, homework, and music, I love to
                        Irish Dance (yes, Irish and Riverdance).  I teach and study professional
                        Irish Dancing.  I've been at that for about five to six years.  I also
                        act on stage since I was in sixth grade (makes me feel old).  "Darkness
                        cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out
                        hate; only love can do that," a  quote from Martin Luther King Jr.  As it
                        says in the Bible in one of the ten commandments: Love your neighbor. 
                        Always be the one that shows love to all, including your enemies.  Jesus
                        did it, why not us.  We are supposed to live like Jesus and He said to
                        show love and kindness.  I can preach a sermon on this specific topic and
                        someday I would love to.  I'm a big Jesus freak (which, there isn't
                        anything wrong with that) and I will always stick up for Christ.  I love
                        the Bible and I do my best to abide by it each day (even I have trouble
                        doing that and always will).</p>

                        <p>My name is Kimmee and I am many things. I am a daughter. I am a sister. I am an aunt. I am a student. I am a musician. I am a poet. I am an artist. I am a photographer. I am a writer. I am a drama geek. But two of the most important things I am are first a child of God and second a volunteer at Crossroads Farm. I work at Crossroads because I feel a strong leading in my life from God to work with the youth of the rural community. As a former student of CRF I have experienced firsthand the difference it can make in the lives of students. Seeing God work in the lives of students has been one of the most amazing experiences in my life.</p>

                <p>Hi my name is Mike, husband to Connie. Outside of work and CRF, my hobbies include running and fishing. My involvement with Crossroads started several years ago. I first become aware of CRF from my oldest child who attended program nights and special outreach activities. I believe God has placed Connie and me with CRF and can tell you that I feel blessed to be a part of the ministry. Not only am I able to assist in helping kids come to know Christ but find the ministry helps in my growth too.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>God has a way of connecting people together. I have had the good fortune of several great friendships with students, several of which I still keep in contact with long after they have graduated. CRF is a needed ministry in Hillsdale County and I am fortunate to be a part of it.</p>

                    <p>Hi, my name is Connie.  I have volunteered with CRF, along with my husband, for the past 8 years.  I love the color yellow, and I love smiley faces!  My favorite Bible verse is Philippians 4:13 "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me."  Sometimes I take on too much, and I hang on that verse, and you know what, He always gets me through!!  I love working with the teens through CRF.  I feel God has led me there, with the help of Doug and Dawn!  I had always prayed that I wanted to go on a mission trip (which someday I will!) and God brought this to me, and after a few years, I realized that yes, this is it for now, right here in my own community!  I pray that God continue to use me to plant the seeds, and to help nurture these delicate young women to stay in God's light, accept Him, and live out Godly lives that He so desires.  I've always told my own children, and I repeat it to "my girls" in my care cell, "do unto others as you would want done to you"  Matthew 7:12.  So, I try to live this out.  That's why I love the color yellow (it's warm, it's like a sunshiney day, it makes me smile).  So, give God your burdens, and start smiling!!!!!</p>

                    <p>I'm a college student at Hillsdale from Portland, Oregon.  Some of my
                        favorite hours of enjoyment come in the great outdoors.  I love campfires
                        with good buddies - its the best way to have a good conversation.  I
                        found Crossroad this fall and joined for the middle school boys.  They
                        have so much energy and help me relax and forget my studies for a few
                        hours a week.</p>

                    <p>Hello to anyone reading this passage. My name is Katina and this is my first year @ CRF.   I am so excited to see what amazing blessings God has in store for each of us this year.  I am married with two beautiful girls, Shelby 10, and Jena 4.  I love to play volleyball, and  I am a huge sports nut!  About 6 years ago God put a passion in my heart to work with the youth of our church.  To this day that passion burns larger and brighter than ever, only now he has given me more of you to love.  I look forward to meeting each and every face who knocks on the door of God’s kingdom.</p>

She loves political theory, politics, new media (time suckers also known as blogging, Facebook and Twitter), hanging out with good friends, and chocolate.</p>
