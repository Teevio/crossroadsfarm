        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Today, perhaps more than at any other time, teenagers need love, care, and understanding. Within the boundaries of rural Hillsdale County, there is little for the teenager to do. Crime is up while teachers and administration have had their hands tied. Parents are afraid to send their kids to school because of the moral decay.</p>

        <p>Crossroads Farm exists in order to provide social, educational, spiritual, and relational opportunities to the secondary students of Hillsdale County. Aim

        Positively impacting rural communities by empowering students, interns and adult leaders.</p>

        <h4>Ministry Vision Statement</h4>

        <p>We at Crossroads Farm see every secondary student in Hillsdale County hearing the Gospel of Christ and having the opportunity to say "Yes" or "No" to that message.</p>
        
        <h4>Ministry Mission Statement</h4>

        <p>At Crossroads Farm, we desire to win students to Christ, build students in Christ and equip students to serve Christ. </p>

        <p>Kids still are just kids. They are impressionable. They are responsive to challenge. They are receptive to positive relationships. Currently, there is little opportunity for the rural Hillsdale County teen to experience those things. Those who work with teenagers are trying, but more needs to be done.</p>

        <p>Crossroads Farm is a non-profit community youth program that meets the needs of secondary students through offering student programing, a monthly coffee house night, positive adult role modeling, recreational activities and strong Judeo-Christian value training.</p>

        <p>Crossroads Farm seeks to impact the community by building a sense of pride through the quality and substance of its mission, while remaining nondiscriminatory in regard to race, religion, or socioeconomic background. Any kid between 6th and 12th grade is welcome.</p>

            <p>Crossroads Farm is still in the beginning stages of hiring its full-time staff and purchasing the farm for daily operations. Renovations include winterization, conversion of the barn into a community youth barn, lighting, sound, stage, seating, restrooms, game room, coffee house, computer lab, etc.</p>

        <p>Grounds renovation of the 105 acres are to include sports fields, basketball courts, rollerblading/biking path, outdoor volleyball courts, wetlands and a wooded fitness trail. In addition, office suites, guest housing, conference areas, and study rooms are part of the future plans.</p>

        <p>Current Programming includes leadership training for students and adult volunteers, weekly youth meetings, tutoring, and drop-in time.</p>

        <p>Full-time staff includes the Farm's Director, an office manager and a music associate. We are looking to hire a Middle school associate and a Creative Resource Director in the future.</p>

        <p>Crossroads Farm has graduated five 2-year interns since it's founding in 1999.</p>
