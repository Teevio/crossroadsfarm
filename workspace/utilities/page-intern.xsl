        <h3>Intern</h3>
        What do I gain by taking an internship in student ministries instead of a job in youth ministry?

        At Crossroads Farm we believe that our internship offers you a few critical things.

        Flying Solo With Friends: Leading Ministry Within the Community of a Youth Ministry Team

        Next year there will be 5 full time ministry staff in the Student Development Program at Crossroads. This team problem-solves, directs ministry and shares resources together. All of this support takes place while you discover your own ministry style.

        Making a Real Difference: A Youth Ministry Experience in a Church that Seriously Needs You

        Crossroads Farm meets the needs of small, rural churches by providing part-time interns to grow their student ministries. Within the next 10 years Crossroads hopes to be able to fill 25 rural churches with youth workers. Without you, these churches have no probability of meeting the needs of area teenagers.

        Here's Your Net: Hands-On Training Without the Risk of Failure

        Most youth workers learn things the old-fashioned way. Trial and error is not all that it's cracked up to be. Can you imagine the first few attempts at parachuting? At Crossroads you can try new approaches that have been proven. You can think though the pitfals before you get to them.

        Surfing On Faith: The Chance to be on the Wave of a New Ministry Paradigm.

        Crossroads Farm offers a youth ministry revolution of team, preparation, provision, and innovation. We are writing the book for a new way of doing youth ministry in the rural communities across America. You can be a part of youth ministry history.

        Time to Refine: Working with and Learning Church Administration without the Burden and Stress of Doing it Alone

        Most youth workers begin to look for greener pastures after just 18 months. Discovering the value of longevity, while working through the necessary evils of each churches' due process, is a major bi-product of working at Crossroads Farm. We commit to be there with you during the first two years of ministry in Hillsdale County.

        Here's My Resume: Most Churches are Looking for the Golden Combination of Education with Experience.

        Where can you gain valuable experience without taking the wrong position in order to get it? At Crossroads we offer exactly that. Then, after completion of the two -year internship, our staff goes to work for you to help find the right position for you. That's a real benefit. 

        What is Crossroads Farm?

        Crossroads Farm is a 105-acre farm in Reading Township, rural Hillsdale County, Michigan. It was founded in May 1999. It exists for 3 purposes: 

        1. to provide youth work interns into local churches who otherwise would not be able to hire one 

        2. to provide free or at cost training for rural youth workers and student leaders 

        3. to provide a weekly outreach meeting designed to attract lost students, to expose them to a real and relevant Christ, to lead them into a relationship with Jesus Christ and to see them planted in a local church.

        Our goals are simple: to win each of the 3,500 secondary students in Hillsdale County to Jesus Christ and to see them planted into a local body of believers....it's just not very easy.

        Crossroads Explained

        Crossroads Farm is currently in a 5-year renovation program. We are restoring 3 turn-of-the-century barns in order to house student programming, special events, and Crossroads staff. The projected cost is nearly $2,000,000 but we have already seen the work begin.

        Currently the Barnyard, Crossroads' weekly outreach, meets at an old church in downtown Reading. The downstairs has been converted into a student drop-in center. It is equipped with pool and ping pong tables, X-Box, Gamecube, Playstation 2, games, air hockey foosball tables, and snack shack. Staff is responsible to be there during drop-in times to build relationships.

        Crossroads runs monthly training sessions and prayer breakfasts, periodical youth worker roundtables, bi-annual fundraising events, annual retreats, and frequent care cell activites. We have seen a ministry explosion. But don't take our word for it. Come out and see for yourself.

        What Kind of Person is Crossroads Looking for?


        Youth ministry is cool in that it takes all types to build a team. We need people with technical skills in computers, sound equipment, and internet specialties. We need creative developers who desire to build into the next rush of youth worship, drama, and communications. We need athletes who can use their skills to coach and train students on and beyond the field and court. We need organized business minds to assist in developing the necessary financial support in a truly entrepreneurial spirit that will help change a county for Jesus. We are looking for a few driven, self-motivated leaders who have an eye on building something new for the Kingdom.

        In short, if you think that God has called you to do youth ministry, and you have the heart of an explorer paired with the will of a missionary, then welcome to the team. This internship program requires that you have graduated and possess a college degree. You will have to be willing to relocate and commit to a two-year program. Be prepared. This is the road less traveled. It will be difficult. It will require constant growth and faith. In the end, however, you will have been refined by fire.

        What positions are you looking to fill?

        We are currently looking for 2 full-time Ministry Interns Immediately. These people work 15-20 hours in a local church and work the rest of their time at the Farm.

        We are also looking for an Intern in Administration who will work with the staff in terms of synchronizing schedules, producing the quarterly newsletter and assisting in all areas of the youth ministry. The experience gained will include aspects of insurance, business, and public relations.

        How do I get started in the process of finding out?	

        Contact us by mail, email, or phone. We will ask that you take a lot of initiative in pursuing us. Feel free to call us and ask about the process.

        What then?

        The scariest words in all of Christian ministry...Fundraising begins. We will send you a book that you need to read. It's FREE when you apply to Crossroads Farm! We will start you on the fast track to raising your support with a one-day fundraising seminar here at the Farm. It'll take the fear right out of raising support. In most cases, our interns have raised full support within 4 months! We think you can do it even faster.

        How Much Am I Responsible to Raise?

        Actually, we begin before you do. Crossroads will find a church in which you will be working. That church is responsible to pick up a minimum of $5.000 toward your support for each of the two years. In addition, you will be raising between 10 and 17 thousand dollars each year, depending on your minimum needs and health care desired. Does that sound like a lot? It's not to God.
